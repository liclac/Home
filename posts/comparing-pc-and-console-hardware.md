Comparing PC and Console Hardware
=================================

Short version: Directly comparing the specifications of a PC and a console is like comparing dogs and cats. They're inherently different.

---

**A PC** needs to be able to run multiple things at the same time.  
These all take resources. Your desktop, chat clients, maybe a web browser (those things are heavy!), a system process checking for updates...  
On top of that, they have to cover for a ton of different possible hardware configurations.

**A console** gives nearly 100% of the system's power to the currently running game.  
Modern ones take a few percent of it for system processes, but it's always quite close to 100%, and you always know how much that 100% is.  
Developers don't need to "play it safe" because not everyone has the lastest hardware; everyone has the same box.

### As an example...
...a modern computer running Windows 7+ or OSX 10.7+ needs at least **4&nbsp;GB&nbsp;RAM** to run a default desktop and a web browser without lag, and usually have some memory dedicated to the graphics. Meanwhile, The Xbox 360 had **512&nbsp;MB** total, shared between system and graphics.

Next time you try to compare an upcoming console's specs to your computer, keep that in mind.
