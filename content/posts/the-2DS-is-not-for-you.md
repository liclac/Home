The 2DS is not for you.
-----------------------

Believe me, if you're reading this, then you are not who Nintendo are trying to appeal to.  
The 2DS looks terrible, won't fit in my pocket, would likely get scratched if I put it in my bag, and thus I certainly wouldn't get one.  
But I'm not who this console is designed for.

All of Nintendo's consoles since the GBA SP have been foldable. There are lots of benefits to this, most notably that the screen is well protected by the outer shell. However, it also brings with it a giant weakness - the hinges.
Give a DS to a small child, and watch as s/he breaks it in half, or makes it impossible to close. A quite expensive console just lost quite a bit of its value.

Guess what the 2DS lacks? Hinges. Show me a kid that can break this thing.  
Now look at the price. It's $50 less than the 3DS, $70 less than the 3DS XL. This is a price range entirely acceptable for an expensive toy.

I have four younger siblings. One of them is seven years old, yet managed to play through half of Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time in a week. All I did was explain some things the were lost in the awful Swedish translation, and teach her the value of using the L2 button to strafe. She's as big of a gamer as a kid her age gets.

Still, I wouldn't get her a 3DS. With how she tosses PS3 controllers around, she'd break it way too quickly.  
This thing? **She couldn't break it if she tried.**
