#### MeidoBot <small>(Python, Cross-Platform)</small><small class="pull-right">[GitHub](http://github.com/uppfinnarn/MeidoBot)</small>
A little bot dressed as a maid, for you to order around.  
Fully cross-platform, and you can write plugins with new orders in a matter of minutes.

#### [Tweetool](http://macaronicode.se/tweetool/) <small>(Python, Web)</small>
A little tool that gives users the features Twitter should already have, such as quick list management and proper avatar uploading.

#### Thallium <small>(C++/QML, Cross-Platform)</small>
A multi-service social networking client, with focus on usability and extensibility.  
Social networking made for users, by users, and extended by users.

#### Houston <small>(Python, Web)</small>
A project manager/issue tracker, because all the other ones I like are written in Ruby. And I'm not having any of that.
